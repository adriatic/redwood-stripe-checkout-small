# redwood-stripe-checkout-small
 
This sample application is a direct "translation" of the next.js application integrated with Stripe checkout - see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQjB1ZjTj8c) created by Darwin Tech. This application is the smallest RedwoodJS application possible - app created by

```
yarn create redwood-app ./redwood-stripe-checkout-small
```
and then stripped to only satisfy Stripe Checkout needs
